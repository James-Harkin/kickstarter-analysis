# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise wants to compare how her project is doing with similar projects.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I constructed a graph to show how likely a kickstarter-play is to succeed based on what month it launched.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The other graph I made demonstrates a kickstarter-play's success rate based on funding goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Constructing the COUNTIFS for the Outcome vs Goals graph is difficult.
I used COUNTIFS that had eight parameters; that's a lot of arguments on one line! Lucky I just
Kept pasting the equation and never got lost.
## Results

- There is a spike of successful campaigns that starts in May and tapers off throughout the summer.
The best kickstarter-plays that you can invest in, are ones that launch in May or June.
- The most likely plays to succeed are the ones with lowest goals.
Also, for some reason, plays that have funding goals between $20k and $35k are especially likely to fail.
- I think some plays succeed because of their popularity alone and ultimately that will cause unexplainable trends in the numbers.
- I think it would be interesting to see whether kickstarter itself has grown. Im not certain the dataset could even provide a good answer.
Are people investing more money into plays now, than they did 5 years ago?
To answer that you could alter the first graph to be Theatre outcomes Based on Year.
